#to-do-list made by Juuso Kortelainen 2000956

Simple to-do list in Javascript with ability to add, check off and remove list items

Saves list items to the local storage and loads them there when started and also has a counter where you can see how many items have been completed

I think the project meets all the given basic requirements and as far as I can tell has no major errors. UI isn't that nice and there isn't too much extra functionality so I would give myself 20 points for this project. Unfortunately it also looks like I have to miss the presentation session.

Actually ran into an error after uploading the site to netlify where there is a "undefined" text at the start of the list, this error doesn't occur when working on firefox locally but does on netlify and with chrome. I wasn't able to fix it or figure out what exactly causes it.
